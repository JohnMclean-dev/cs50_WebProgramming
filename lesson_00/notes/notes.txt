    HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language

14
    first line represents HTML declaration (what version)
    All html files must have a...
        head element (information about the web page, user does not see) and a...
        body element (visible part of the page user can see).

    Document Object Module (DOM), diagram explaining the structure of html elements

23
    <ol>__Ordered list
    <ul>__Unordered list
        <li>__list item

    <img src="">__image element which requires a source of said image, use alt to represent image if error occurs. Has no closing tag as there is no content that would be stored within the image. Self closing tag.

    <a>__anchor which requires href (hyperlink reference)

    CSS - Cascading style sheet

    best practices
        do not rely on in line styling, use the style element in the header element
        i.e.
        <style>
            h1 {
                color: blue;
                text-align: center;
            }
        </style>

        note style can also be in it's own css file also referenced in the header
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

        rule of thumb, if you are writing the same lines of code multiple times there is a better way

        padding - space content within the element
        margin - space element from other elements

        font-weight - bold, italics, etc.

        <style>
            h1 {} <!-- styles element -->
            #foo {} <!-- styles id -->
            .baz {} <!-- styles class -->
        </style>

31
    use selectors to specify styling of elements based on a user defined hierarchy 

    a:b for use with conditional scenarios, i.e. button:hover for hovering over a button

33
    viewport - area of the screen that the user can see (i.e. desktop vs smartphone)
